\section{Objective}
To simulate interactions between government, industrialists and public and find resultant distribution of resources. 

\subsection{Design \& assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item For comparison sake, a common denominator for all resources is wealth or money.
\item  Interactions between all agents are transactions, in money terms.
\item Agents have attributes: \textbf{need}, \textbf{produce} and their \textbf{behaviour}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{To Do}
Come up with specifications of attributes in English, then in money. Qualify \textbf{behaviour} as a set of possible actions. Quantify \textbf{need} in money terms.

\begin{itemize}
\item Study agent rules - Read Sugarscape. Library: NetLogo
\end{itemize}
